**MERN: Full-stack Ticketing Application**

https://ticketing-fronend.vercel.app/monitoring

**Introduction:**

The MERN stack which consists of Mongo DB, Express.js, Node.js, and React.js is a popular stack for building full-stack web-based applications because of its simplicity and ease of use. In recent years, with the explosive popularity and the growing maturity of the JavaScript ecosystem, the MERN stack has been the goto stack for a large number of web applications. This stack is also highly popular among newcomers to the JS field because of how easy it is to get started with this stack.


This repo consists of a Ticketing Application built with the MERN stack. I built this app to practice coding while learning the MERN stack and eventually refactor it and improve once I land a job as a developer.

This is a full-stack ticketing application that can be up and running with just a few steps. Its frontend is built with Material UI running on top of React. The backend is built with Express.js and Node.js.


**Features:**

This application provides users with the following features

  •Authentication using JWT Tokens
  •Updating User Profile
  •Creating/Cancelling Tickets for "user" role
  •Search Engine for User Tickets
  •Process, Complete, and Cancel tickets for admin role
  •Search engine for all tickets for admin roles
